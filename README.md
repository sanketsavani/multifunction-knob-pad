# Raspberry Pi Pico Application Controller

The Raspberry Pi Pico Application Controller is a simple hardware project that enables control over various functionalities on a computer using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and a rotary encoder. This project facilitates volume control, application switching, and desktop switching on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.

## Features

- **Volume Control:** Use the rotary encoder to adjust the system volume.
- **Application Switching:** Quickly switch between multiple open applications using the rotary encoder.
- **Desktop Switching:** Navigate between virtual desktops (available on Windows and Linux).

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Rotary Encoder
- Push Button
- Electrical components for circuit connection

## Software Requirements

- Adafruit CircuitPython Library
- Python (for running the script on your computer)

## Usage

1. Connect the hardware components as per the wiring diagram.
2. Install the necessary CircuitPython library on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
3. Upload the provided Python script to your Raspberry Pi Pico.
4. Run the script on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
5. Rotate the encoder to control volume, switch between applications, or switch desktops.
6. Press the button to switch between different control modes.

## Notes

- Ensure your Raspberry Pi Pico is properly connected and recognized by your computer.
